# PySAMP-CLI
PySAMP-CLI is a command-line development tool for developers
who are interested in developing SA-MP servers in Python using [PySAMP](https://github.com/PySAMP/PySAMP).

This project is currently WIP and may have major changes, and
it's not for production.

## Todo
- [ ] Defining base-model of every object that we are looking to use
- [ ] Pull system to store pulled resources in users storage
- [ ] Server initializer to make SA-MP or OMP server files and install [PySAMP](https://github.com/PySAMP/PySAMP) on them
- [ ] App feature which will give developers the ability to create reusable apps
- [ ] Default settings for [PySAMP](https://github.com/PySAMP/PySAMP) server and app list to manage app inclusion
- [ ] Maybe add new configuration style on git repos(like the [sampctl](https://github.com/Southclaws/sampctl) pawn.json) to install libraries written for [PySAMP](https://github.com/PySAMP/PySAMP) or even plugin implementation
